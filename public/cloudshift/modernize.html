                                <p>Modernization to cloud offering addresses organizations who are still running applications built decades ago. These applications – and newer applications – often have complex interdependencies, inflexible architectures, redundancy, and out-of-date technology. This poses serious challenges in unlocking business value and optimizing cost of ownership. Application Modernization Strategy will drive faster execution, reduced cost, and ongoing alignment of business needs and information technology. It is more than an assessment of current state or high-level statement of future direction.  It identifies specific initiatives that can deliver near-term value. It enables continuous delivery of value through multiple, incremental modernization initiatives that take into account business priorities, technical constraints, and the complex interdependencies in an application portfolio.</p>
								<p><strong>Modernization to Cloud</strong> offering is the process of modernizing application client portfolio in a methodical path.</br>
								<p> It offers:</br>
								&nbsp • &nbsp	Rapid API Enablement</br>
								&nbsp • &nbsp	Rewrite in Microservices Architecture</br>
								&nbsp • &nbsp	Custom Rewrite</br>
								&nbsp • &nbsp	As Is Conversion</p>
								<p><strong>IBM Successful Application Modernization Strategies embrace three principles:</strong></br>
								<p><strong>1: &nbsp Modernize where it matters</strong></br>
								Use business value as the lens through which modernization options are viewed. Set the strategy to enable growth, improve customer experience, reduce costs, and speed delivery.</p>
								
								<p><strong>2: &nbsp Simplify and streamline</strong></br>
								Size and complexity constrain change. Reduce size through rationalization: consolidation and decommissioning. Reduce complexity through standardization and decoupling of interdependencies.</p>
								
								<p><strong>3: &nbsp Deliver results early and often</strong></br>
								Big-bang modernization efforts are risky. They may fail for technical reasons, or they may be cancelled before delivering results. Break large initiatives into smaller projects with measurable impact. Accelerate value delivery and reduce risk.</p>

								<p><strong>Step 1: &nbsp Capture knowledge on the applications</strong></br>
								Application inventory data is consolidated from existing sources. The business and IT value taxonomies are established. Cognitive tools are used to analyze existing documents, to accelerate the capture and organization of information on applications; existing business and IT value data is leveraged. Knowledge gaps are identified, and a plan to close the gaps is prepared and executed</p>
								
								<p><strong>Step 2: &nbsp Assess business and IT value</strong></br>
								In this step, applications are mapped to business capabilities or processes. The business capabilities and processes are assessed against the business value criteria and taxonomy established in step 1. Applications are assessed against the IT value criteria and taxonomy. Gaps in the application-to-business mapping are identified and resolved.</p>
								
								<p><strong>Step 3: &nbsp Evaluate opportunities and define roadmap</strong></br>

                                <p><strong>IBM’s modernization strategy utilizes cognitive analytics, automation and cloud to drive solutions that improve performance and reduce costs. IBM uses proven analytics and patterns, developed over hundreds of successful programs, to create a modernization roadmap. IBM’s pattern based and cognitive analytics approach provide insights into processes and applications that can improve business agility and  flexibility. It also uses analytics to identify areas that are targets for archiving and retirement automation factories.  This allows our clients to quickly realize cost savings that can fund innovation. IBM CAMS draws on hundreds of successful modernization programs in which we have helped our clients envision and achieve a highly optimized IT run.</strong></br>
								<p>There are several scenarios that drive the approach that organizations can take for modernizing their applications.  These scenarios are driven by business priorities and legacy constraints.  The four different scenarios can be summarized as follows:</p>
								
								<p>1. &nbsp The organization is faced with competitive situation where it needs to have an aggressive customer centric strategy to reach existing customers and build new channels to provide new and appealing interaction experiences; easy to use interactions with the enterprise, more and better services, ubiquitous end to end transactions, etc.  Taking time to redevelop legacy applications is not an option and new mobile and web applications need to be deployed in weeks, not months; certainly, not years.  Rapid API enablement is the answer.</p>
								<p>2. &nbsp Even while implementing a quick API enablement program, the organization realizes that there are substantial benefits in modernizing – innovative disruptive thinking – complete business processes; or even opening new channels and opportunities that require a complete redevelopment of key – not all – business processes.  The final target is to create these new applications on a modern platform that supports the organization growth.  This calls for a microservices architecture strategy.</p>
								<p>3. &nbsp Not all applications are suitable for a microservices strategies.  Limitations due to platform considerations and business constraints may require to target a services-enabled architecture but not a complete microservices adoption. Redevelopment to a services oriented but more traditional architecture may be required</p>
								<p>3. &nbsp Finally, there may be urgent platform obsolescence considerations that require the organization to remove the platform in a short time period and convert the application to a new platform – typically Java based – to allow for retirement of the obsolete technology.  In this case a conversion approach is required.  This is a temporary measure that will require further application remediation and modernization at a future stage.</p>

                                <p><strong>How is CloudShift Migrate to Cloud different than server replication, scripting, templates and manual migration?</strong> </p> 

<p>CloudShift -> Migrate to cloud  is a predictable migration solution that automates the application information collection, identifies the application dependency and migrate of application workload and their associated metadata/configuration into cloud.  Step-by-step migration methods offers automated migration of workloads without any pre-processing on the source environment or post-processing on the target cloud to minimize business disruption. </p> 

<p><strong>What is the basic difference between migrating application workloads and servers? Aren't they the same?</strong></p>

<p>Application installed in servers containing the OS, the applications and platforms (e.g. application servers, databases) associated with the workload.   Application Workloads typically include the entire suite (servers), data storage (data may be stored on attached and/or networked storage) and the network and system configurations associated with the workload. Our migrate to cloud method ensures application entire workload can be migrated seamlessly with minimum business intervention.</p>


<p><strong>Does CloudShift  Migrate to cloud supports migrate to SaaS?</strong></p>

<p>Yes – Our analytical tools supports to identify the application source pattern to create the right target cloud pattern and execute the migrate process according to the best suitable pattern to avoid business disruption while taking vantage of cloud.</p>

<p><strong>Does CloudShift Migrate to cloud require a proprietary environment to import application information into prior to migration to cloud platform ?</strong></p>

<p>It does need a transient environment to support the conversion before application workloads are deployed into the target cloud platform. This is only required if application workload needs conversion e.g. platform upgrade or remediation etc. Our migrate toolset is capable of hosted either in client environment or target cloud platform to pull the application binaries, data accordingly to network connection used between source and target cloud connection. </p>

<p><strong>What does it mean to migrate a server live?</strong></p>

<p>It means that production servers can be migrated without having to take them down out of production during the migration.  Once the migration is complete and the workload is configured and tested on the target cloud environment, the client can set up a change window to cut-over to the new VM deployed in the target data cloud.</p>

<p><strong>What Platforms Does Migrate to cloud support?</strong></p>

<p>It supports migration from physical, virtual and cloud platforms to cloud platforms. Supported OS, hypervisors and Clouds are: </p>
  
                          
<ul>
    <li>Source OS – Windows 2003/2008/2012, Linux, AIX </li>
<li>Target Clouds – IBM Bluemix, AWS VPC, VMWare vCloud, Azure or private cloud platform. </li>
  
  </ul>


<p><strong>Do I need to install anything discover application information ?  What about agents?</strong></p>

<p>Our discovery toolset is an agentless technology, so you will not need to install agents. We can also leverage existing client discovery tool and repository to pull the data out and load into our SCOPE analytics to understand application source environment and it's common pattern to derive the appropriate migration path. </p>

<p><strong>How it's different than other Cloud migration service ?</strong></p>

<p>Yes, our migration capabilities are more geared with enterprise application assessment, creating the right migration roadmap to minimise client risk. Our large toolset supporting migration assessment, planning and execution is end-2-end automated to get a most predictable outcome in a short period of time. Migrating the workload is no-brainier today, we differentiate ourself in migrating the right workload at the right cloud platform to take the vantage multi-cloud environment of a hybrid cloud solution for our client. We make sure our client leverages our migration roadmap to plan their application portfolio appropriately to spend their budget most wisely.
